# Python-Wallpaper-Switcher
A simple Python app to switch your background in the MATE Linux desktop environment.
It will randomly select a picture from a directory you choose, as long as it's a picture file.

You can adjust the length of time before it switches pictures by adjusting the Minimum and Maximium time,
the program will pick a random time between the two values and switch the picture.

There are plenty of programs that do this same thing with more features, but I mostly just wanted to try to figure it out myself and have fun with a little project to kill some time. :)
